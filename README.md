ðŸš€ Machine Learning System for Airbus A400M Fuel Leak Detection

Collaborated with Airbus to develop a machine learning pipeline predicting fuel leakages aboard A400M aircraft using 20+ million time-series sensor records.
	â€¢	Led data cleaning, advanced feature engineering, and synthetic anomaly generation to compensate for scarce labeled leaks.
	â€¢	Designed and optimized an autoencoder-based anomaly detector, complemented with XGBoost and Isolation Forest, achieving over 80â€¯% precision in identifying fuel anomalies.
	â€¢	Delivered an interactive post-flight dashboard (built with Python + dashboarding tools) to visualize detections and support phased deploymentâ€”projected savings of >$30K/month per aircraft.
	â€¢	Technologies used: Python, Autoencoders, XGBoost, Isolation Forest, time-series modeling, and operational dashboards.
