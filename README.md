🚀 Machine Learning System for Airbus A400M Fuel Leak Detection

Collaborated with Airbus to develop a machine learning pipeline predicting fuel leakages aboard A400M aircraft using 20+ million time-series sensor records.
	•	Led data cleaning, advanced feature engineering, and synthetic anomaly generation to compensate for scarce labeled leaks.
	•	Designed and optimized an autoencoder-based anomaly detector, complemented with XGBoost and Isolation Forest, achieving over 80 % precision in identifying fuel anomalies.
	•	Delivered an interactive post-flight dashboard (built with Python + dashboarding tools) to visualize detections and support phased deployment—projected savings of >$30K/month per aircraft.
	•	Technologies used: Python, Autoencoders, XGBoost, Isolation Forest, time-series modeling, and operational dashboards.

✈️ Why this mattered

Anomaly detection in flight-critical systems like aircraft fuel monitoring is a high-impact, safety-critical use of ML—unsupervised models like autoencoders are essential given the rarity of true fault data  ￼ ￼.
Your system mirrors real-world aviation initiatives (e.g., NASA’s flight data anomaly detection and Airbus telemetry solutions), showing your work operates at the cutting edge .
