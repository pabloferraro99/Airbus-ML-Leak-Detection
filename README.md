## 🚀 Machine Learning System for Airbus A400M Fuel Leak Detection

Collaborated with Airbus to develop a machine learning pipeline predicting fuel leakages aboard A400M aircraft using 20+ million time-series sensor records.

- Led data cleaning, advanced feature engineering, and synthetic anomaly generation to compensate for scarce labeled leaks.  
- Designed and optimized an autoencoder-based anomaly detector, complemented with XGBoost and Isolation Forest, achieving over **80% precision** in identifying fuel anomalies.  
- Delivered an interactive post-flight dashboard (built with Python + dashboarding tools) to visualize detections and support phased deployment — projected savings of **>$30K/month per aircraft**.  
- **Technologies used**: Python, Autoencoders, XGBoost, Isolation Forest, time-series modeling, and operational dashboards.

## ✈️ Why this mattered

Anomaly detection in flight-critical systems like aircraft fuel monitoring is a high-impact, safety-critical use of ML — unsupervised models like autoencoders are essential given the rarity of true fault data.  
This system mirrors real-world aviation initiatives (e.g., NASA’s flight data anomaly detection and Airbus telemetry solutions), demonstrating that the project operates at the cutting edge of applied machine learning in aerospace.
